# Welcome to Build

This is where we explore the art and science of building things that matter. From zero to one, from idea to product, from product to company.

## What you'll find here

In this pillar, we cover:

- **Product Development** - Frameworks for building products people actually want
- **Startup Strategy** - Lessons learned from the trenches
- **Growth** - Sustainable approaches to scaling
- **Case Studies** - Deep dives into what worked (and what didn't)

## The philosophy

Building is an iterative process. The best products come from deep customer empathy, rapid experimentation, and relentless focus on what matters.

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs

Let's build something great together.
