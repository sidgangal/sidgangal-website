# Welcome to Invest

This is where we explore the principles of building long-term wealth. Not get-rich-quick schemes, but sustainable approaches to growing your money over decades.

## What you'll find here

In this pillar, we cover:

- **Index Investing** - The boring but effective approach
- **Portfolio Construction** - Asset allocation that makes sense
- **Market Analysis** - Understanding macro trends without the noise
- **Real Estate** - Building wealth through property

## The philosophy

Investing is a long game. The best returns come from patience, discipline, and avoiding the temptation to time the market.

> "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient." - Warren Buffett

Time in the market beats timing the market. Let's think in decades.
