heroHeadline: For knowledge workers wanting to exit the rat race

  Modern life is quietly working against us. 


  Our food is engineered for cravings, not nutrition. Our days are spent
  sitting. Our attention is auctioned to the highest bidder.


  We're running faster just to stay in place. Costs rise, savings erode, and the
  rules of the game keep shifting.


  Much of what fills our time wasn't chosen by us - it was designed by outside
  powers. Social media, status anxiety, endless consumption. We've been
  optimized for someone else's goals.


  This is where I write about what I'm learning. The insight that keeps proving
  true: small habits compound, and knowledge changes everything.


  I write across three areas:

  AI and how the world is changing - not fear, but practical insight and real
  experience

  Wealth and peace of mind - growing money without letting stress consume you

  Health as nature intended - treating the body the way it was designed to work
