  I built a technology company for seven years, sold it, and learned that the
  same principles that grow startups also grow wealth and health. This is where
  I write about all three - and how they compound together.


  I am in no way an expert in anything I write in. I normally learn, do, and
  write to document my experience for myself. Thought about sharing with the
  world as an experiment.
