I'm Sid Gangal. I spent seven years building a company, sold it at 26, cried for two weeks deciding whether to let go, and then had to figure out what to do with myself—and my money.

This site is where I write about the three things I've learned compound: building products, growing wealth, and optimizing health.

## Build — Why I Write About Startups

In my final year at IIT Mandi, while everyone sat for placements, I submitted a pitch to a startup competition. I didn't win. But something clicked.

I started Solar Labs with co-founders I'd met through college festivals and the placement cell (one of whom had actually fired me from my campus job). We lived four people in a 3BHK, slept in the co-working space surrounded by pizza boxes, and spent 1.5 years building a product before we had anything to sell.

Our first real enterprise deal came from a Tata Power executive who remembered a pitch we'd given four years earlier—when we had no product, just slides and conviction. He remembered us not for the deck, but because we kept showing up.

Seven years later, we exited to a US company. I was 26.

The startup had become my identity. I was the company and the company was me. The decision to sell was logical—what took us seven years, I could now do in three with this experience. But logic doesn't stop you from crying in your room for two weeks.

Now I'm building again. This is my jam. Building companies, building yourself, just building stuff. It's amazing.

**What I believe about building:**

- Action trumps perfection
- You have to show up—again and again
- "Go talk to customers" is the only advice that matters
- Funding is taking on responsibility, not achieving success
- The grind builds character whether or not the startup works

## Invest — Why I Write About Markets

After the exit, I had capital and needed to put it to work.

It was early 2022. Markets were at all-time highs. There was euphoria everywhere. I had a strange discomfort handing my money to mutual fund managers or dumping it into an index. Something felt overvalued.

So I did something unusual: I put everything in fixed deposits and spent a year studying.

I read about 2008. I studied the Covid crash. I watched the market while everyone else was buying. I also made mistakes—invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a startup right after getting my payout. All of it went down within months. One startup I angel-invested in went belly up.

But that patience with the rest of my capital saved me.

When markets crashed in late 2022 and early 2023, I deployed. India and US markets. Those investments did well—15% alpha over the indexes.

I'm competitive. I wanted to beat the market, not just match it. And I wanted to understand what I owned. Public markets are regulated, transparent, liquid. You can see the products, read the financials, form your own thesis. If you're right, you make money. If you're wrong, you can get out.

**Current focus (2025):**

- Dividend stocks and safe havens
- Learning global markets beyond India/US
- Studying Ray Dalio's framework on economic cycles

**What I believe about investing:**

- Invest your own money—you'll be calmer in drawdowns
- Patience in deployment matters as much as stock selection
- Understanding beats outsourcing
- Take care of others' money better than your own

## Thrive — Why I Write About Health

I was always the fit kid. Football, basketball, cricket through school. College basketball and football teams. Sports was my thing.

Then I started a company.

For seven years, I paid zero attention to my health. I was so fit when I started that my past took care of me—until it didn't.

Post-exit, I got a full body checkup. The results were a wake-up call:

- Cholesterol: High
- Vitamin D3: Dangerously low
- Vitamin B12: Dangerously low
- hsCRP (inflammation marker): 1.6—crazy high

On a typical Indian vegetarian diet, I had starved my body of protein for years. The inflammation was oxidizing me from the inside. That's what ages you.

Within a year, I brought my hsCRP under 0.5.

I started reading. Peter Attia on why exercise is the most powerful intervention against chronic disease. David Sinclair's story about his father—old, declining, then started NAD+ and focused nutrition, and suddenly he's hiking with the grandkids with a whole new lease on life. Bryan Johnson's "crazy experiment" that's actually not that crazy when you look at the science.

I want to live to 100-120. But more importantly, I want to live those years well—walking, traveling, doing things, not restricted to a bed. The goal is maximum healthspan, not just lifespan.

**What I focus on:**

- Sleep (the foundation)
- Nutrition (especially protein on a vegetarian diet)
- Exercise (Peter Attia's framework)
- Reducing inflammation

## The Compounding Philosophy

These three pillars reinforce each other.

Building gives you capital. Capital buys time. Time lets you invest in health. Health gives you energy to build more.

Each compounds. Together, they compound faster.
