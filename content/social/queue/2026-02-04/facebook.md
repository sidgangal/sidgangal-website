# The AI Infrastructure Stock That Escaped Russia

## Content

I wrote a deep dive on The AI Infrastructure Stock That Escaped Russia. Here's what I found.

Most investors have never heard of Nebius. They know Nvidia. They know the hyperscalers. They've probably heard someone at a dinner party mention CoreWeave. But Nebius? The company that went from being worth $30 billion to getting delisted, sanctioned, and left for dead, only to crawl back onto the Nasdaq and rip 500% in three months?

To understand Nebius, you need to understand Arkady Volozh. He's the guy who built Russia's answer to Google, and now he's building something entirely different in the West.

Volozh started working on search technology in 1989. Let that sink in. While most of the world was still figuring out email, this guy was building search engines. He co-founded Yandex in 1997 and spent the next two decades turning it into Russia's everything company. Search. Maps. Ride-hailing. Payments. Cloud computing. By 2021, Yandex was worth $30 billion and traded on the Nasdaq under the ticker YNDX.

I wrote up the full deep-dive on my site:
