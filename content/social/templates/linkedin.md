## Example

```
I spent 47 hours researching Nebius, the AI infrastructure spin-off from Yandex.

Here's what most investors are missing:

They went from $30B to delisted to 500% gains in 15 months. That doesn't happen by accident.

The secret? Two decades of Nvidia relationships from their Yandex days. While others wait months for GPUs, Nebius gets priority allocation.

Microsoft and Meta just signed $22B+ in contracts with them. The hyperscalers are outsourcing AI infrastructure to a company most people have never heard of.

Full deep-dive on my site (link in comments).

What's your take on the AI infrastructure buildout?
