- Conversational, personal tone
- Storytelling angle works well

- Minimal or no hashtags (1-3 max)
- Can include a question to drive comments

## Template Structure

[KEY INSIGHTS - 2-3 main takeaways]

[LINK - Direct URL]

[ENGAGEMENT QUESTION - Optional]
```

## Example

```
I just spent 47 hours researching one company. Here's why it was worth it.

Every once in a while, you come across a story so unusual that you have to dig deeper. Nebius is one of those stories.

Two years ago, this company was dead. They were part of Yandex, Russia's version of Google. When Russia invaded Ukraine, they got delisted from the Nasdaq. Their founder got sanctioned. Most investors wrote them off completely.

But here's what happened next:

They executed the largest corporate exit from Russia in history. Sold everything for $5.2 billion. Moved hundreds of engineers out of the country. The founder got his sanctions lifted. And they rebuilt the company in the West.

Fast forward to today: Microsoft just signed a $17.4 billion contract with them. Meta signed for $5 billion. The stock is up 500% in 15 months.

What do they do? They rent out AI infrastructure - the GPUs that every AI company needs to train their models. And they have relationships with Nvidia that go back 20 years, which means they get hardware that others can't.

I wrote up the full deep-dive on my site - the bull case, the bear case, and everything in between.

Curious what you think - is AI infrastructure the best way to play the AI trend?
