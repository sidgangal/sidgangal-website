## Example

```
TWEET 1:
I spent 47 hours researching Nebius.

From $30B Russian tech giant to delisted and sanctioned to 500% gains in 15 months.

Here's the story most investors missed:

TWEET 2:
Nebius is what emerged when Yandex (Russia's Google) executed the largest corporate exit from Russia in history.

They sold all Russian assets for $5.2B and moved hundreds of engineers out of the country.

TWEET 3:
The secret weapon: 20+ years of Nvidia relationships.

While new entrants wait months for GPUs, Nebius gets priority allocation.

Nvidia even led their $700M funding round.

TWEET 4:
Microsoft just signed a $17.4B deal with them.

Meta signed $5B.

The hyperscalers - with unlimited resources - are outsourcing AI infrastructure to Nebius.

That tells you something.

TWEET 5:
Revenue grew 355% last quarter.

They're targeting $7-9B annualized by end of 2026.

From $550M to potentially $9B in one year.

TWEET 6:
