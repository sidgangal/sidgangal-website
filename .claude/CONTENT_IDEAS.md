## PODCAST QUOTES TO USE

From the IIT Mandi Catalyst podcast, useful quotes for content:

> "At the end, what am I going to lose? A year's salary, two years of salary. Compared to later years, it's not significant."

> "Action trumps perfection. Go ahead and do it."

> "Funding is taking on responsibility. You always have to take care of someone else's money even better than your own because someone has trusted you with it."

> "The journey of doing a startup builds character and builds a lot of strength."

> "Startups are 24/7 and all-consuming. The first thing you wake up thinking about is the startup. The last thing before sleep... consistently for so many years was just something related to the startup."

> "The startup became part of my own identity. I was the company and the company was me."

> "You have to show up. You have to be there. You have to talk to customers."
