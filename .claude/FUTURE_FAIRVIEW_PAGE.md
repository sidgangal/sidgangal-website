**When to implement:** When Fairview's product suite is launched and ready for public visibility.

### Overview

Fairview Software is Sid's current venture - an AI-Native Growth Stack focused on B2B Companies.

### The Big Idea

Fairview pairs a suite of interconnected AI tools to help grow revenue through a streamlined analytics + agentic workflow made for businesses.

The AI tools provide:
- AI technology applications and team members
- Research knowledge
- A data lake with many companies' growth signals to learn how to improve our own signals

### Why Fairview Wins

1. **Data-to-Action moat** - Others stop at dashboards; Fairview triggers tasks & content automatically
2. **Cost advantage** - India-based engineering + SDR talent at ~30% of Silicon Valley burn
3. **Founding DNA** - IIT alumni who stole US share from a $400M-funded rival on <$2M budgets, managed teams of 60+ people
4. **AI-first operating system** - Every workflow runs through agent copilots day-one
5. **Acquisition experience** - Team has sold, integrated, and scaled inside a big-co post-acquisition

### Product Portfolio

**T1 Products (Volume/Funnel):**
- P2 - Personal Branding AI: Voice-cloned posts, comments & DMs triggered by ICP signals
- P3 - Company Social Poster: Keyword-graph content, AI-undetectable copy, 20-language auto-localization
- P4 - SEO Autopilot: Pillar-cluster generator, code-fix bot, headless CMS push
- P5 - Customer-Success Copilot: Instant ticket triage, sentiment-churn alerts, upsell nudges
- P6 - Sales Assistant Agent: Instant objection handling, auto-populates CRM, sales training

**T2 Products (Deep Moat):**
- P1 - Analytics Accelerator: Turns raw interactions into "Closed-Won DNA"; auto-creates next-best actions → 80% RevOps workload cut

### T1 vs T2 Framework

- **T1:** Smaller agents, easy to make & onboard, act as funnel for volume
- **T2:** Data and deep engineering tools, higher onboarding cycles, deeper integrations, harder to replace

All T1 tools embed into one master flow - a Full user accesses all functionality in one place.

### Timing Thesis

GenAI has crossed usability thresholds (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) but enterprise workflows remain un-automated. The next 24-36 months are the decisive window before incumbents re-platform.

### Roadmap

| Timeline | Milestone |
|----------|-----------|
| Q1 2026 | Launch P4 MVP, 100 paying seats via founder networks & Product Hunt |
| Q2 2026 | P2+P3+P4 bundle with deeper P1 |
| H2 2026 | Enterprise suite launch, $1M ARR run-rate |
| 2027 | $20M ARR, $200M+ valuation |
| 2028 | $50M ARR, $750M+ valuation |

## Implementation Notes

- Create as `/src/pages/fairview.astro` or as a Build pillar post
- Consider whether it should be in main nav or just linked from About page
- May want separate pages for each product (P1-P6) as the suite matures
